            <h2>A letter to my wife</h2>
            <p>Remember that one time we built a fort and fell asleep together telling jokes
                and loling at all the things? That was awesome. Thanks.
            </p>
            <h3>I wrote you a poem:</h3>
            <blockquote>
                Roses are red,<br>
                Violets are red,<br>
                Everything is red.
            </blockquote>
            <p>You are so beautiful, obvy. Here is a list of things that your beauty far exceeds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sunsets</li>
                <li>Tulips</li>
                <li>Turkey sandwiches</li>
                <li>The smell of desert rain</li>
                <li>The sound of laughing babies</li>
                <li>Perfectly semantic code</li>
            </ul>
